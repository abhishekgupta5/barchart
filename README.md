# Barchart like visualizations using Bokeh, Flask

Data visualizations are generally preferred with JS libraries like d3.js but often it's easier to knock out a few lines of python code to get the job done.
With Bokeh, we can create traditional as well as detailed interactive visualizations.
In this weekend project, Flask is used with Bokeh to create custom bar charts in a python single page web app
